	// retention settings and can be associated with workspace API keys.
	Workspaces AdminWorkspaceService
	// API keys authenticate requests to the Boltz API. There are two key types: admin
	// keys have full access to all management and compute operations across the
	// organization, while workspace keys are scoped to a single workspace and can only
	// perform compute operations (predictions, protein design, small molecule design)
	// within that workspace. Keys can be created in live or test mode. Test keys
	// (prefixed `sk_bc_*_test_`) create test-mode resources with synthetic data and no
	// GPU cost. Every resource includes a `livemode` field indicating its mode.
	APIKeys AdminAPIKeyService
	// Retrieve aggregated usage data for the organization. Usage can be grouped by
	// workspace and/or application, and filtered by time range, workspace, and
	// application.

// request. These options are applied after the parent client's options (if there
// is one), and before any request-specific options.
