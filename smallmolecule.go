// SmallMoleculeService contains methods and other services that help with
// interacting with the boltz-compute API.

// Note, unlike clients, this service does not read variables from the environment
// automatically. You should not instantiate this service directly, and instead use
// the [NewSmallMoleculeService] method instead.
